I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Göttingen, in the department of Economics and the Center for Modern Indian Studies, having completed a PhD in Economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (2021). In my research, I use theoretical and applied microeconomics to study behaviors such as learning and voting, with a focus on developing countries. I also study the game theory of conflict and cooperation in a development context. I will be on the 2022-2023 job market.
