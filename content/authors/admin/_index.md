I have a PhD candidate in Economics from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and am incoming Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Göttingen in the department of Development Economics. My research focuses on developing countries, particularly the microeconomics of development in the agricultural sector and elsewhere. I also study the game theory of conflict and cooperation in developing countries.
