abstract = "Why have Israel and the Palestinians failed to implement a land for peace solution, along the lines of the Oslo Accords? This paper studies the application of game theory to this question. I show that existing formal models of the conflict largely rely on unsupported assumptions about what the main actors are trying to achieve. A more realistic specification would acknowledge the existence of fundamentally conflicting claims over the land as well as the importance of the land for future bargaining power."
