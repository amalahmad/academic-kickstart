abstract = "Surgical care in developing countries grapples with both financial and organizational problems. The financial problems are well understood by global health organizations, which often donate equipment and organize short-term volunteer missions in response. The organizational problems, however, are less well understood. This chapter explains how the poor organization of the most valuable medical resource in any country - human capital - affects the capability development of local surgeons, and how these problems can be alleviated through the development of context-specific learning-by-doing surgical programs in target countries."
