# Abstract and optional shortened version.
# abstract = "This paper provides the first quasi-experimental evidence on the extent to which economic benefits programs have contributed to the electoral triumphs of the Hindu-nationalist party (BJP) in India. I study a national program through which the BJP incumbent has transferred development funds to villages with a high share of disadvantaged castes. Focusing on Indiaâ€™s largest state, I match villages to polling booths, and use a multiple-score regression discontinuity to identify the effects of past and expected transfers on village-level voting in the 2019 general elections. I find that neither treatment contributed to the BJP's victory among this important swing constituency."
